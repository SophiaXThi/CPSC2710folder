# Food Picker

## Created using JavaFX, Maven, and CSS
## Purpose: CPSC 2710
## Usage: To help user pick out what they want to eat from a list of choices

### How to use this:  
The app works is the user picks from a selection of pre-chosen 
food choices by selecting the checkboxes next to the food choices
The program will randomly pick from the selected choices when the 
pick button is selected and display the winning choice in the label
When the search button is selected, a separate window will pop up 
allowing the user to search for restaurants in the area using Google
where the user can put in the selected choice. 

The Google pop up window can be closed at any time and the user can delete
their choices and start over if they choose. They can do this by doing one 
of three methods. 
1. Using the delete button to delete the choices
2. Going to menu -> edit -> delete
3. Using Ctrl + D to delete

Known issues: N/A I worked hard to avoid null references where I could and
added print statements to make sure the choices were added to the list and 
removed from the list depending on the checkbox choices. 

### Keyboard shortcuts
Ctrl+Q closes the app
Ctrl+D deletes the choices
Ctrl+A opens the about section
